# Tinkering in Python
Just tinkering and finding new things to learn in Python

## `ttkbootstrap` 
`ttkbootstrap` is essentially Tkinter done right — a modern theming layer that makes classic Tk apps look clean and professional with almost zero effort.

"*ttkbootstrap* is a Python library that enhances tkinter by providing modern, flat-style themes inspired by Bootstrap. Easily create stylish GUI applications with built-in themes, pre-defined widget styles, and more." ~ https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap

**What ttkbootstrap Is:**
- A modern theming + widget extension for tkinter.ttk
- Inspired by Bootstrap (web) design language
- Pure Python, no JS, no web stack
- Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)

**Think:**
- *Tkinter* + *dark mode* + *consistent spacing* + *modern* colors

**ttkbootstrap is perfect when you want:**
- Python-only
- Fast development
- A modern-looking desktop UI
- Minimal complexity

**Where It Falls Short:**
- ❌ No mobile support
- ❌ Still Tk under the hood
- ❌ Limited animations
- ❌ Not suitable for large, consumer-grade apps

python -m pip install ttkbootstrap
```
